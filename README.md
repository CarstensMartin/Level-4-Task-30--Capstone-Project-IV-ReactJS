# Level 4 Task 30 -Capstone Project IV: ReactJS

## THE TASK AT HAND

Create a full-stack web application that interfaces with the two most popular VCS providers to facilitate a seamless browsing experience. Integrate with the GitHub and GitLab APIs (both free and open).

Implement the following features:

● User search box - with results from all three platforms.

● User details - including some of their repos, their profile picture, bio, etc.

● Repo details - including last commit date, creation date, description, etc. Should also list the last 5 commits’ descriptions.

1. Your code for interfacing with the third-party API’s should be handled by the backend of your application.

2. The UI should be attractive, easy to use and intuitive. This means clicking on a user from the search results should go to your app’s user details page. Use different coloured links for links that go outside your app (e.g. a user’s page on a VCS provider)

3. Since some endpoints may be doing multiple requests to multiple third-party API’s, expect your backend to be slow to respond at times. Have loading icons where appropriate.

4. You should ensure that your application has been appropriately tested. You should include at least one snapshot test and appropriate unit tests for both the front-end and back-end of the application.

5. Use Helmet to help secure your Express app.

6. The file structure of the project should be well organized and easy to understand and use. The code should also be easy to read adhering to Google’s style guide about indentation, meaningful variable and component names etc.

7. Your code should be well documented with appropriate comments.

Project limitations:

1. You do not have to authenticate users at this stage.

2. You do not have to create a database for this application.

3. Your app need not do any caching of third party API responses.

4. Do not integrate with any authenticated (private) third party API endpoints.

Just focus on publicly accessible data.
